<details><summary>Conclusion of Testing</summary>

The testing phase for the Hangman - Snare the Rope Edition project was thorough, covering functionality, user experience, and bug resolution. Both automated validation through the CI Python Linter and manual testing were employed to ensure a stable and error-free gaming experience.

The testing process significantly contributed to refining the project, resulting in a stable, user-friendly, and entertaining gaming experience.

### Future Considerations
The testing phase provided valuable insights, leading to potential future improvements:

- **Bug Resolution:** Addressing the unresolved bug related to spamming inputs.
- **User Interface Enhancements:** Continuously improving visual and interactive elements for an enhanced gaming experience.
- **Feature Additions:** Exploring opportunities to add multiplayer mode, more visuals, a leaderboard, and an expanded wordlist.

</details>

<details><summary>Future Code Enhancements</summary>

In future iterations of the project, I plan to enhance the codebase by incorporating more robust exception handling syntax. Additionally, I intend to refactor the main game loop, 'hangmanthegame', into smaller, well-organized sections. This restructuring aims to improve readability and maintainability, making it easier for both assessors and myself to comprehensively test different functions.

I identified the need for these improvements during manual testing, realizing that a more structured approach would enhance the overall quality and understandability of the code.
